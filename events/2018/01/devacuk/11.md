### 11. Dealing with technical debt - Christopher Gutteridge, University of Southampton

**Description:**     In the days of malware, GDPR and the rest, how do we cope with legacy systems built by you, or your predecessors, that are now a liability? How do we handle the politics of decades of evolving technology? Chris will start the session with a short talk on his experiences (15 mins) and then lead a discussion to discuss people in the room’s challenges and the group’s suggestions on how to address them. A note taker will attempt to capture the best bits into a document we can improve on later and share with the community. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vd8yOagTPPDcZsHpNMh-bIiKL3tjPDb4xrbXbP1hrdM/edit\#">This document</a> was produced in a similar session last year

**Topics to be covered:**  Coping with technical debt, strategic procrastination, tips on tech and politics
