### 14. The Jupyter Ecosystem - Tony Hirst, Open University

**Description:** Originally developed as IPython notebooks, Jupyter Notebooks provide a browser based, interactive programming environment that blend text, executable code and code outputs (tables, charts, embedded HTML widgets) in a single document. Designed initially to support reproducible research, notebooks are increasingly used to support teaching and learning as well as research. But the notebooks are only part of the story. This session will review the whole Jupyter ecosystem, including: Jupyter notebooks as notebooks as well as interactive slideshows (Jupyter RISE); creating runnable Jupyter notebook environments from Github repositories (Binderhub); using notebooks to define APIs and dashboards; Jupyter multi-user notebook server (Jupyterhub); hosting considerations

**Topics to be covered:** Jupyter notebooks, Jupyterhub, repo2docker, Binderhub, hosting requirements (so a bit of dockerâ€¦)
