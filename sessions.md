Title: Building a Learner Management System: a Just In Time approach
Type of session: Presentation
Short description:
The University of Strathclyde recently moved its lifelong learning programme to an online self-service portal where learners can find, enrol, pay for and manage their classes. The new portal also incorporates the full range of administration and reporting functionality including programme management, learner management and integration with the central university student records system. The presentation will explore how the portal is being developed form both a technical and project management perspective.
The portal is being developed from scratch by the Development and Innovation Team on a .NET CMS platform (DNN) using a mix of T-SQL, C#, JavaScript and CMS plugins. We will investigate how this heterogeneous mix of development approaches is managed, and what we have found to be the benefits and complexities.
 
The portal is being delivered using a “just-in-time” agile approach with learners and administrators using the system as its functionality is being fleshed out. The presentation will explore the challenges of this approach and how it can be made to work for learners, administrators and developers.
Topics to be covered: Agile Project Management, .NET + JavaScript development
Approximate length of session: 30min
Presentation requirements: (just need to connect own laptop)
Prerequisites for delegates attending the session: N/A

Title: How can we teach coding to scientists?

Type of session: Presentation/Lightning talk/Hands on/Demo/Other

I think this is an Other, but closest to a presentation.

Short description:

Many scientists, myself included, have found themselves learning how
to be developers.   We have had to do this in order to do our
scientific work efficiently, correctly, and in a way that can be
shared.   Coding is at the heart of modern data analysis.  There is a
great deal of agreement that we need to teach many or maybe all
students how to code, but - how do we do that?  Should we teach coding
separately from data analysis or statistics?  Do we need to use easy
tools, or can we get away with teaching "best practice", including
testing and version control?  Should we teach coding everywhere - to
arts and science students alike?  If we are going to do that, how will
the universities we work in have to change, and how will we get there?
  What can we do for the students who find this very hard to learn?

I will present the various approaches that I know of, including some
live demonstrations of some of the latest tools, such as JupyterLab
and interactive code / text Jupyter Notebooks.  I will present some
recent courses I have been involved in that have tried to teach these
methods, in Berkeley and Birmingham.  We will stop from time to
discuss the issues that arise, and think of new ways of thinking about
pitching and teaching.  I hope we'll come to a shared understanding of
how to iterate towards a real solution to this urgent problem.

Topics to be covered:

* The actual role of code in science at undergraduate and graduate level.
* Current state of play in terms of training and skills.
* Where we'd like to be in 10 years time.
* Attitudes of faculty to code and teaching.
* Current initiatives for teaching code, with at least one live
demonstration of tools and approaches.
* Barriers to progress, and a discussion of how to overcome them.

Approximate length of session:

90 minutes.

Presentation requirements:

Projector; whiteboard.   It would be good to have a room where people
can move tables into arrangements that help in group discussions.

Title: The Jupyter Ecosystem
Type of session: needs a good half hour; could be done as a practical session up to 2 hrs; whatever fits best
Short description: Originally developed as IPython notebooks, Jupyter Notebooks provide a browser based, interactive programming environment that blend text, executable code and code outputs (tables, charts, embedded HTML widgets) in a single document. Designed initially to support reproducible research, notebooks are increasingly used to support teaching and learning as well as research. But the notebooks are only part of the story. This session will review the whole Jupyter ecosystem, including: Jupyter notebooks as notebooks as well as interactive slideshows (Jupyter RISE); creating runnable Jupyter notebook environments from Github repositories (Binderhub); using notebooks to define APIs and dashboards; Jupyter multi-user notebook server (Jupyterhub); hosting considerations.
Topics to be covered: Jupyter notebooks, Jupyterhub, repo2docker, Binderhub, hosting requirements (so a bit of docker…)
Approximate length of session: as required to fit the programme
Presentation requirements: network connection, Data projector
Prerequisites for delegates attending the session: if we do interactive stuff, laptops, network connection.
